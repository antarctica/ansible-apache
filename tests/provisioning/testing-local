# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for the 'testing-local' environment

# It is best practice to group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[vagrant-test]
barc-apache-test-web1.v.m

[vagrant:children]
vagrant-test

[all-servers:children]
vagrant


[barc-apache-test-webservers-local]
barc-apache-test-web1.v.m

[barc-apache-test-webservers:children]
barc-apache-test-webservers-local
