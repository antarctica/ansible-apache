# Bootstrap roles

This directory is intended for roles used to bootstrap the provisioning process,
 specifically only roles used to bootstrap the host machine.

You **SHOULD NOT** add roles, including *boostrap* type roles, to this directory,  
you **SHOULD** use the `roles` directory instead.

Typically this directory will only ever contain one role called *ansible-prelude*.

For more information please contact a member of the BAS Web & Applications Team.
