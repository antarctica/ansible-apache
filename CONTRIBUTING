CONTRIBUTING

We welcome contributions from both other NERC centres and from external entities under the following guidelines:


* These are general guidelines used by default for projects that we make available, they do not represent any formal policy or notice.

* The preferred method of integrating contributions is through a Git pull request.

* The preferred method of raising issues is through the NERC Jira issue tracker, or via e-mail if external to NERC.

* If contributing code, please follow any defined coding standards where specified, or any obvious conventions implied within the code.

* Please see either the "NERC STAFF" or "EXTERNAL" section as appropriate to you.
